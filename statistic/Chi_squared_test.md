# Chi-squared Test

is the variation in your data just due to chance or is it due to one of the variables that you are testing

x^2 = sum((O-E)^2/E) - ki-squared value
O - observed
E - expected

Ho - There is no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies

look at the table for p=0.5 and get critical value
if ki-squared value is larger than critical value you reject,
if it is smallar, you do not reject the null hypotesis
