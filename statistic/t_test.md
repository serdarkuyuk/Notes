# T-test

comparing two groups if the difference of two group is statistically different

t-value = signal/noise ratio
signal : number that tell me the difference between these two samples
noise : numbers that kind of getting the way

singal = difference between group means = |x1 - x2|

variability of groups sqrt(s1^2/n1 + s2^2/n2) s-standard deviation

lets assume t-value is larger than 1, 2.3

Ho - There is no statistically significant difference between the samples
Ho
Do not reject <- ^ -> reject (leads to 2.3)
|
critical
value
2.04 (from the table)

look at the table
for Ho ---- degrees of freedom for p - 0.05
df = n1+n2-2

p is the probability lets say 0.5 - inferential statistics
if we were to do this sample a hundred times 95 of the times we would reject the null hypotesis and only 5 percent we would not reject...

independent (unpaired) samples means two different population
paired samples means two samples from the same population

assumptions
Normal distribution - population and samplese
similar variance
Datapoints -same number (20-30+)
